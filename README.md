# Dead Game Roster

DGR is an app that allows users to add characters to a database, and use them to build war rosters for a totally not trademarked MMORPG.   It allows users to keep track of which players are using which builds, and input your armies scores after a war and it will generate helpful player perfomance stats.  Percentage of total Damage, Healing, Kills, Assist, KDR (kill/death ratio).  Making it easier to determine which players were the most effective overall.
