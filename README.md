# Dead Game Roster

DGR is an app that allows users to add characters to a database, and use them to build war rosters for a totally not trademarked MMORPG.   It allows users to keep track of which players are using which builds when building potential rosters to make it easier to balance their army based on their strategy.    You can also input your armies scores after a war and it will generate helpful player perfomance stats.  Percentage of total Damage, Healing, Kills, Assist, KDR (kill/death ratio).  Making it easier to determine which players were the most effective overall.



##
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I used Javascript, react, and CSS for styling.   It uses a local JSON server as a database.


##
DGR was created as a front end capstone project for Nashville Software School 
https://github.com/nashville-software-school

##
DGR is still a work in progress, there are features I would still like to implement on the front end, and I hope to eventually write the server side instead of using a local database.
