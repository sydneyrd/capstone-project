            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>This is a tool for tracking your roster's performance in war. It is a work in progress and a solo project, so please be patient with me as I add features and fix bugs.</p>
            
            <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
            <p>
                You can view war boards that have been made public by clicking the "view public boards" button on the main page.
                you'll need to create an account to create a roster, view characters, or enter war stats.  
            </p>
            <h2>I found a bug</h2>
            <p>Great!  Please contact me and let me know so I can fix it.</p>
            <h2>When will *whatever* feature be added?</h2>
            <p>When I have time to work on it.  I'm a one person team, so I'm working on this in my spare time. I have quite a few plans, but please contact me and let me know what you think should take priority</p>
<h2>I have some other question</h2>
<p>Great!  Please contact me.</p>
