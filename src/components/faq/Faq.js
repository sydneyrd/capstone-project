            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>This is a tool for tracking your roster's performance in war. It is a work in progress and a solo project that I am just building for fun, so please be patient with me as I add features and fix bugs.</p>
            
            <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
            <p>
                You can view war boards that have been made public by clicking the "view public boards" button on the main page.
                you'll need to create an account to create a roster, view characters, or enter war stats. 
                Once you've created an account, you can view all created characters. 
            </p>
            <h2>I found a bug</h2>
            <p>Great!  Please contact me and let me know so I can fix it.</p>
            <h2>When will *whatever* feature be added?</h2>
            <p>Hopefully soon, but depends on how much time I have to work on this. I am working on specific features, but would love to hear what you would like to see prioritized.</p>
<h2>I have some other question</h2>
<p>Great!  Please contact me, I don't know what to put here.</p>
